# Fitness Hacks for Life: Wellness eCommerce Platform Analysis

_At Fitness Hacks for Life (FHFL), a wellness platform and eCommerce site, their mission is to foster mental well-being through empathy, compassion, and evidence-based information. They create a safe and inclusive space where individuals can access reliable mental health resources, connect with a supportive community, and explore tools such as articles, personalized journal templates, and workbooks to navigate mental health challenges and relieve stress._

_In this project, I used Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Tableau to analyze the effectiveness of their digital advertising campaigns, aiming to enhance the FHFLâ€™s outreach and impact._
