**Recommendations**
Newsletter Sign Up Optimization: Since this campaign showed strong performance, consider leveraging this by offering additional incentives, exclusive content, or targeted follow-ups to further increase engagement and conversions.
Mind Journals Campaign: Investigate why the CTR dropped to 0% on several days after August 11. It could be due to lack of relevance, outdated content, or changes in targeting.
Ads for Journals/Workbooks: This campaign had periods of strong performance but also showed some volatility. Regular monitoring and optimization (e.g., A/B testing, refreshing ad content) could help smooth out the dips and maintain high engagement.
Focus on Consistency: Campaigns like Yoga Books and Sales need better strategy refinement to avoid consistently low performance. Revisiting the ad copy, targeting, or offers may help boost CTR.
Broaden Impressions for Underperforming Campaigns: For campaigns with lower impressions, such as Yoga Books and Mind Journals, experiment with different keywords, audience segmentation, or platforms to increase reach.
