# Fitness Hacks for Life: Wellness eCommerce Platform Analysis

_At Fitness Hacks for Life, a wellness platform and eCommerce site, their mission is to foster mental well-being through empathy, compassion, and evidence-based information.

In this project, I used Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Tableau to analyze the effectiveness of their digital advertising campaigns, aiming to enhance the companyâ€™s outreach and impact._
