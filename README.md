3. **Enhance Data-Driven Decisions:** Use insights to increase return on investment (ROI) and support FHFL's mission to provide accessible mental health resources.

## Insights and Performance Overview 

### What We Learned:
- **Successful Campaigns:** The ads for journals/workbooks and newsletter signups demonstrated consistent activity throughout the campaign period. The newsletter signup campaign stood out, achieving an impressive click-through rate (CTR) that frequently exceeded 20% on select days, indicating a strong interest in email subscriptions.
- **Challenges with Certain Campaigns:** In contrast, the Yoga Books and Sales campaigns exhibited erratic performance, often showing 0% CTR on multiple occasions. This inconsistency suggests a need for deeper analysis and strategy adjustments to enhance engagement.
### Regional Performance:
- **North America** led with over 8,000 impressions, suggesting a larger audience or stronger engagement.
- **EMEA** was close behind, but **LATAM** and **APAC** need more targeted efforts to increase their engagement.
### Device Insights:
- **Desktop Usage:** High in NA and APAC, indicating that these audiences engage more in professional settings.
* **Mobile Usage:** EMEA showed the strongest mobile engagement, suggesting we should prioritize mobile-friendly content there.

## Conclusions and Opportunities
- **Focus on LATAM:** To boost performance, we need to improve our ad targeting and content to better resonate with this audience.
- **Leverage Newsletter Success:** We should consider incentives for newsletter signups to further increase conversions.
- **Investigate Declining Mind Journals:** We must analyze why this campaign's performance dropped to make necessary adjustments.
- **Enhance Mobile Experience:** Tailoring content for mobile users in EMEA can unlock additional engagement opportunities.

## Measurable Goals for the Next Six Months
1. **Increase Newsletter Conversions:** Aim for a 20% increase by offering targeted follow-ups.
2. **Improve Mind Journals CTR:** Target at least 5% in the next month by refining our content.
3. **Boost Mobile CTR:** Increase by 10% in EMEA and APAC within two months.
4. **Enhance Desktop Engagement:** Achieve a 15% increase in NA and APAC through optimized content.

By focusing on these goals and implementing our insights, FHFL can enhance engagement and effectively support its mission of promoting mental health awareness.


_**Important CTR Note:**_ Campaigns with lower impressions often experience more significant fluctuations in both CTR and total clicks. This should be taken into account when analyzing the data.
